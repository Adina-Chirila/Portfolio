                        My interest in Front- end Development started back in
                        2019. After graduating my Masterâ€™s Degree and changing a
                        few jobs in fields not related with development, I found
                        myself not being satisfied with the activities I was
                        doing at work and I felt that my potential was not fully
                        used.
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                        Then I realized my professional career should change, so
                        I started looking for fields that I thought could be
                        built on a continuous learning path, and could offer me
                        the motivation I needed. That's how I found Front-end
                        development, a growing field that offers me the
                        challenges I need in order to develop myself and grow
                        professionally. So I started reading, learning, watching
                        tutorials and building projects, and now, I feel pretty
                        confident that I can be productive in a business and
                        turn my passion into a career.
